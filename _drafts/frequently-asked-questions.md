** What is Volt? **

Volt is a platform to electrify your web apps. It provides simple hosting and extended services for your web and mobile apps.

As a web host, it provides an easy to use interface to deploy apps, custom names using full https on a fast, stable platform.

Extended services include user management, server storage and will include a steady supply of new services. Let us know what you’re interested in!

** How safe is my data? **

** What technology does it use? **

(james)

** What does it cost to use? **

We provide several tiers of service, depending on your needs, starting from a free plan.

** Can I host my apps on it? **

Yes. When you deploy your app to Volt, we take care of the rest. No worries about security certificates, manifest file configuration, updating servers or maintaining the server stack. 

** I used to host my web app on Dropbox. Can I use Volt instead? **

Yes. Dropbox announced that on Oct 3, 2016, they will no longer allow content to display in-browser. Acting as a web server isn’t what they wanted to do. Volt is designed to be the optimal server for web apps.

** Can I run PHP on Volt? **

That’s what we’re trying to get away from. PHP can be tricky, especially for new users. Setting it up and keeping it running is also a chore. Volt will have many of the features people use PHP for, in a much easier to use environment.

** I need a custom service. Can I talk to you about it? **

Yes. Drop us a line at hello@voltcloud.io. If we think your idea might be useful to other users (and you don’t mind), we’ll even give you a break on the dev costs.

** Volt calls my app https://www.mygreatapp.volt.live. Can I use my own URL? **

Soon. We will let you use a URL of your own choice (like http://www.mygreatapp.com), so long as you control the mygreatapp.com domain. Some setup will be needed. 

The result will be that apps will look like they originate from your website, but are actually served by Volt.

## What are the Terms of Service (TOS)? ##

The Terms of Service are [here](https://www.nsbasic.com/app/AppStudioTOS.txt).

## FAQ for AppStudio Users

(probably should go into AppStudio FAQ as well)

** Do I need to be an AppStudio user? **

Just during the soft launch. After that, we’ll open up Volt to everyone.

** How is this different from the AppStudio Server (nsbapp.com)? **

It does everything the AppStudio server did, plus a lot more.
Apps can be hosted permanently
Apps can be restricted to certain users.

If you are on AppStudio 5 or older, the AppStudio server will continue to work. Our intention is to phase it out.
