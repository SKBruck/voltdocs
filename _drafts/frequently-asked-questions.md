**What is Volt?**

Volt is a platform to electrify your web apps. It provides simple hosting and extended services for your web and mobile apps.

As a web host, it provides an easy to use interface to deploy apps, custom names using full https on a fast, stable platform.

Extended services include user management, server storage and will include a steady supply of new services. Let us know what you’re interested in!

**How safe is my data?**

Your data on Volt is backed up by a reliable and redundant on-site solution. Hard drive failures are tolerated by utilizing RAID across many drives.

The Volt server is built on industry standard technology. All updates and security advisories are installed on a continuous basis.

**What does it cost to use?**

Initially, there is no cost. There will be several tiers of service, depending on your needs. We expect there will always be a free plan.

**Can I host my apps on it?**

Yes. When you deploy your app to Volt, we take care of the rest. No worries about security certificates, MIME type configuration, updating servers or maintaining the server stack. 

**I used to host my web app on Dropbox. Can I use Volt instead?**

Yes. Dropbox announced that on Oct 3, 2016, they will no longer allow content to display in-browser. Acting as a web server isn’t what they wanted to do. Volt is designed to be the optimal server for web apps.

**Can I run PHP on Volt?**

That’s what we’re trying to get away from. PHP can be tricky, especially for new users. Setting it up and keeping it running is also a chore. Volt will have many of the features people use PHP for, in a much easier to use environment.

**I need a custom service. Can I talk to you about it?**

Yes. Drop us a line at hello@voltcloud.io. If we think your idea might be useful to other users (and you don’t mind), we’ll even give you a break on the dev costs.

**Volt calls my app https://mygreatapp.volt.live. Can I use my own URL?**

Soon. We will let you use a URL of your own choice (like https://www.mygreatapp.com), so long as you control the mygreatapp.com domain. Some setup will be needed. 

The result will be that apps will look like they originate from your website, but are actually served by Volt.

**What are the Terms of Service (TOS)?**

The Terms of Service are [here](https://www.nsbasic.com/app/AppStudioTOS.txt).

## FAQ for AppStudio Users

(probably should go into AppStudio FAQ as well)

**Do I need to be an AppStudio user?**

Yes, for now. Soon, we’ll open up Volt to everyone. Contact us at hello@voltcloud.io for early access.

**How is this different from the AppStudio Server (nsbapp.com)?**

It does everything the AppStudio server did, plus a lot more.
Apps can be hosted permanently
Apps can be restricted to certain users.

**Can I continue to use the AppStudio Server?**

If you are on AppStudio 5 or older, the AppStudio server will continue to work until April, 2017.
AppStudio 6 always uses Volt.

**How do I sign up for Volt?**

Two ways:

Here’s where to order your: [subscription](https://www.nsbasic.com/i/Subscription/). It includes Volt and AppStudio 6. With the Pro package, you’ll get [Premium Support](https://www.nsbasic.com/app/support.php/).

You can also simply [order](https://www.nsbasic.com/i/Order/) the AppStudio 6.0 upgrade. It costs $49.95 and and includes a 3 month subscription to Volt Essential. After that, you can can choose to continue to subscribe to Volt Essential for a monthly fee, or revert to the free Starter package.

** Why has AppStudio switched to subscription billing?

The software world has changed since AppStudio was first released. A single upfront price  does not take the different needs of users into account. Our cost base has also changed: apps rely more on cloud services which are charged monthly fees. Virtually all dev tools companies have switched already.

It also helps us by providing a continuous budget to improve AppStudio and Volt.

**Can I use Volt with AppStudio 5?**

Sorry, no. It does not have the interfaces required. The AppStudio Server which AppStudio 5 uses is scheduled to be shut down May 1, 2017.

**Does it cost extra to use Volt?**

It depends on the plan you choose. The Demo/Starter plan is free.
