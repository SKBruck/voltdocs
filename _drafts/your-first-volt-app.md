Instructions on how to initialize create a new app, get your app ID, initialize Volt and upload your code. 

## For AppStudio Users

AppStudio is tightly integrated with Volt, making it easy to upload, run and manage your apps.

#### Uploading to Volt

On the Run menu, choose "Deploy to Volt". Your app will be uploaded to Volt and the URL to run it will be displayed. The Volt AppId will be placed in your [Project Properties](https://wiki.nsbasic.com/Properties_Window).

#### Managing your App

If you have subscribed to AppStudio and have entered a Volt password, you can use the Volt [Dashboard](https://dashboard.voltcloud.io/) to [manage your apps](/users/managing-your-apps).

You can open the Dashboard at [https://dashboard.voltcloud.io/#](https://dashboard.voltcloud.io/#) or from the AppStudio [Run menu](https://wiki.nsbasic.com/Menu_Options).

#### Managing your Volt Account

If you have [subscribed](https://www.nsbasic.com/i/Subscription/) to AppStudio on any of the plans (including the free demo), you're entitled to deploy to Volt from the AppStudio Run menu.

To use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.voltcloud.io/), you'll need a Volt account. If you have a Starter, Essential or Pro subscription, you're entitled to a free Volt account. Reply to the registration confirmation email by setting up a password and you'll be allowed to use it.

You can also set up a Volt account from the AppStudio Run menu or from [Volt Preferences](http://wiki.nsbasic.com/Preferences).
