Volt supplies a [Dashboard](https://dashboard.voltcloud.io/) to help manage your apps. One of its features is that you can use it to manage the users who have signed up for the app.

## Users

Here is what you see when you log into the Dashboard, choose an app and click on the Users button:

![User Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/managing-your-users.png)

Each of your users is shown, whether they are confirmed or not.

To delete a user, click on the Delete button. All information about the user will be permanently removed. The user will have to sign up again to use your app.

**Delete All Users** will delete all the users of your app. Use this very carefully!
