# Contributing to Volt Documentation

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Volt!

## How to Help

There a couple of ways you can help improve the Volt documentation:

* [Submit as issue](https://github.com/arsmentis/volt-docs/issues/new) if you found a typo or omission. We'll work with you to get it fixed. You can also request or propose new articles.
* [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to submit fixes and new content directly. We'll review your request and work with you on getting it integrated.
  * If you don't have a GitHub account, [sign up](https://github.com/join) for one.
  * You can edit an existing post, or even create an entirely new post by using the Github's tools:
    * To edit an existing post, navigate to that post and click on the "Edit this file" button (it looks like a pencil).
    * To create a new post, click on the "Create new file" button. Please only make new posts `_drafts`. Take a look at other posts in `_posts` to get a feel for the proper format. Our [README](https://github.com/arsmentis/volt-docs/blob/master/README.md) and the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) may help.
  * After you make your edits, GitHub will walk you through submitting a pull request.
  * We'll review your request and communicate with you if any changes need to be made.
