## General

### What is Volt?

Volt is a platform to electrify your web apps. It provides simple hosting and extended services for your web and mobile apps.

As a web host, it provides an easy to use interface to deploy apps, custom names using full HTTPS on a fast, stable platform.

Extended services include user management, server storage and will include a steady supply of new services. [Let us know](mailto:support@nsbasic.com) what you’re interested in!

### How safe is my data?

Your data on Volt is backed up by a reliable and redundant on-site solution. Hard drive failures are tolerated by utilizing RAID across many drives.

The Volt server is built on industry standard technology. All updates and security advisories are installed on a continuous basis.

### What does it cost to use?

Initially, there is no cost. There will be several tiers of service, depending on your needs. We expect there will always be a free plan.

### Can I host my apps on it?

Yes. When you deploy your app to Volt, we take care of the rest. No worries about security certificates, MIME type configuration, updating servers or maintaining the server stack. 

### I used to host my web app on Dropbox. Can I use Volt instead?

Yes. Dropbox announced that on Oct 3, 2016, they will no longer allow content to display in-browser. Acting as a web server isn’t what they wanted to do. Volt is designed to be the optimal server for web apps.

### Can I run PHP on Volt?

That’s what we’re trying to get away from. PHP can be tricky, especially for new users. Setting it up and keeping it running is also a chore. Volt will have many of the features people use PHP for, in a much easier to use environment.

### I need a custom service. Can I talk to you about it?

Yes. Drop us a line at support@nsbasic.com. If we think your idea might be useful to other users (and you don’t mind), we’ll even give you a break on the dev costs.

### Volt calls my app https://mygreatapp.volt.live. Can I use my own URL?

Soon. We will let you use a URL of your own choice (like https://www.mygreatapp.com), so long as you control the mygreatapp.com domain. Some setup will be needed. 

The result will be that apps will look like they originate from your website, but are actually served by Volt.

### Are there any restrictions on what I can do with Volt?

Nearly any legal use is acceptable. You can learn more from our [terms of service](https://www.nsbasic.com/app/AppStudioTOS.txt).

### Who can use it?

Initially, just AppStudio users. If you're not an AppStudio user, please contact us if you would like to get early access. Note that the service is just launching and we're still likely to make changes to it. Contact us at <support@nsbasic.com> for early access.

## AppStudio Users

### How is this different from the AppStudio Server (nsbapp.com)?

The AppStudio Server was designed to help with development, but not permanent hosting. Volt is a permanent hosting solution. It provides all the tools you need to either host your app, or provide a backend for a hybrid app or existing server.

### Can I continue to use the AppStudio Server?

If you are on AppStudio 5 or older, the AppStudio server will continue to work until May 1st, 2017. AppStudio 6 always uses Volt.

### How do I sign up for Volt?

Volt is free with your [subscription](https://www.nsbasic.com/i/Subscription/) to AppStudio 6! By subscribing you’ll receive continual updates to AppStudio, plus access to Volt Essential - our new cloud services platform built from the ground up to work with AppStudio.

If you are using a demo of AppStudio 6, you are able to sign up at our Starter level for free by clicking on the “Run” menu and choosing “Sign-up/Sign-in to Volt”.

### Why has AppStudio switched to subscription billing?

In order to continue providing you with the innovative, high quality product you are used to, AppStudio has transitioned to a subscription billing. This transition will not only allow us to continue making AppStudio more useful to you, but also allow us to provide tight integration with a cloud service provider built from the ground up for AppStudio - namely Volt.

### Can I use Volt with AppStudio 5?

Sorry, no. It does not have the interfaces required. AppStudio 5 is only designed to work with AppStudio Server.

### Does it cost extra to use Volt?

If you purchase a subscription to AppStudio, then Volt is free for the duration of your subscription. We highly suggest purchasing a subscription to get the most out of AppStudio and Volt.  It is possible to use a limited version Volt without a subscription to AppStudio as well.

### When I try to reset my password I get a message "Unauthorized". What do I do?

Account activations expire after an hour. Fortunately, getting a new link is easy:

1. Navigate to [https://dashboard.voltcloud.io/](https://dashboard.voltcloud.io/)
2. Click on “Forgot your password?”
3. Enter in the email address you registered with.
4. A new email should arrive shortly.
