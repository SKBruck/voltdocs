# Introduction
Volt.io is a cloud service which provides additional functionality for AppStudio. It's designed as a platform, so new features can be added.

It replaces the AppStudio Server, but does much more. Some of the initial features are:

* App Hosting: Apps uploaded to Volt.io can be accessed by users anywhere in the world. Permanent hosting is available.

* Custom Domains: Use the Volt assigned domain, or have your site point to it on Volt.
 
* App Management: The Dashboard lets you display and configure the apps you have on the Volt.io server.

* User Management: Control the list of users who are able to use your app, by giving them sign on codes.


# Managing your own Account
If you do not have an account, you will still be able to deploy apps. They will be available for about an hour. If you want to apps to remain longer or use Volt features, you will need to sign up.

To sign up, go into the Volt tab in AppStudio Preferences and click on "Sign up for Volt". Follow the instructions and a free Volt account will be set up for you. Once this is done, enter the Email and Password for your account into AppStudio's Volt Preferences panel.

# Using Volt from AppStudio

* Deploy to Volt: Run Menu. This uploads your app to the Volt server. If you have an account, it should be entered into Preferences. If you do not, the app will only remain on the server for an hour.

* Manage your Volt App: Run Menu. This opens the Volt Dashboard to your currently loaded app and lets you customize its features.

* Sign In/Sign Up to Volt: Run Menu. This opens the Volt Dashboard and lets you sign in to manage your apps. If you do not have an account, you can sign up for one here.

- Volt Preferences: in Preferences. Use this panel to enter your Volt email and password. This will let AppStudio sign you on directly when you deploy.
