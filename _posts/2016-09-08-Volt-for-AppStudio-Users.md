# Introduction

Volt.io is a cloud service which provides additional functionality for AppStudio. It's designed as a platform, so new features can be added.

It replaces the AppStudio Server, but does much more. Some of the initial features are:

• App Hosting: Apps uploaded to Volt.io can be accessed by users anywhere in the world. Permanent hosting is available.

• Custom Domains: Use the Volt assigned domain, or have your site point to it on Volt. 

• App Management: The Dashboard lets you display and configure the apps you have on the Volt.io server.

• User Management: Control the list of users who are able to use your app, by giving them sign on codes.


# Managing your own Account

If you do not have an account, you will still be able to deploy apps. They will be available for about an hour. If you want to apps to remain longer or use Volt features, you will need to sign up.

To sign up, go into the Volt tab in AppStudio Preferences and click on "Sign up for Volt". Follow the instructions and a free Volt account will be set up for you. Once this is done, enter the Email and Password for your account into AppStudio's Volt Preferences panel.
