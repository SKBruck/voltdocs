    - target_blank to open in new window
    - link from site, fairly prominent
  - Main Content
    - getting started guides - not created yet
    - like blog post
      - don't need the blog features
        - no dates in post or url
    - summary of the most recent guides on the front page
    - may have some hard links
    - reverse chronological
      - defer to me
      - would pages be better?
      - use jekyll compose plugin
    - MAIN PAGE
      - sample documentation posts?
      - intro paragraph
      - cross between wiki and blog
        - ex: linode, heroku
  - make a repo for myself for now

- Static site
  - wants to let ppl search, but not rely on google site search
  - look for JS-based search options based off an index page
    - look for a jekyll plugin all client-side search 30 min

Notes - 2016.04.07

- Wants to add new categories manually
- James will manage the API/JS pages
- Don't worry about reverse chronological order

- Logo - could be bigger?
- optimize spacing for 675-700px browser height
  - wants to see categories w/o scroll
- Move the searchbar up - top navbar
